                I'm Julian, a Full-Stack Developer from the Tampa Bay Area. And I'm here to help your organization.
                Coming from a background in hospitality,
                particularly special events, I know what it means to work in cooperation with others. Likewise, I bring
                a
                "get to yes" philosophy when it comes to gratifying clients and satisfying thier needs. Creativity
                inspires
                me and drives me to find resourceful methods to challenges I face.
            </Paragraph>
